## src/client - Frontend 

This directory is the home for the frontend for tesc.events. 

tesc.events' frontend is written entirely in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). It was initially written in JavaScript, but [was ported over to TypeScript in April 2019](https://github.com/UCSDTESC/Check-in/pull/131)

The entry point to the code is in [main.tsx](https://github.com/UCSDTESC/Check-in/blob/master/src/client/main.tsx)

Routes for the application (/user/, /admin/ etc.) are set up in [routes.tsx](https://github.com/UCSDTESC/Check-in/blob/master/src/client/routes.tsx)

The main application code lies in [pages/](https://github.com/UCSDTESC/Check-in/blob/master/src/client/pages)
